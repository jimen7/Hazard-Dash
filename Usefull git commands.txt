1) Creating and pushing into a new branch:

In Git 1.7.0 and later, you can checkout a new branch:

git checkout -b <branch>
Edit files, add and commit. Then push with the -u (short for --set-upstream) option:

git push -u origin <branch>
Git will set up the tracking information during the push.




2)if you want to download a branch and clone it, clone the master repository and then do:

git checkout <branchname>

and when you want to push back to the Branch do:
git push -u origin <branchname>




3)Do you want to merge a 'develop' branch into master?  (ALWAYS DO THIS AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY COPMMITED TO BRANCH)

git checkout master
git merge develop


4)Or do you want to merge the changes from master into your development branch?

git checkout develop
git merge master
